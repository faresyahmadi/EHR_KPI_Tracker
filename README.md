# Collaboration with ERIOS: Enhancing Electronic Health Records (EHR) Navigation üöÄ

This project was conducted in collaboration with ERIOS: Space for Research and Integration of Technological Tools in Health, a contractor of the Ministry of Health in France. This experience was part of the Industrial Project course in Polytech Montepllier üè´. Our goal was to enhance the efficiency of Electronic Health Records (EHR) navigation by designing a tracking tool that enables researchers and healthcare professionals to analyze and optimize user interactions with the system.

### PROJECT OVERVIEW ü§î

We developed a navigation tracking tool that allows researchers to assign navigation zones within the EHR system, enabling comprehensive tracking through Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as:  

-Time Spent Navigating ‚Äì Measuring the duration of user interaction within specific zones.  

-Number of Clicks ‚Äì Tracking user engagement levels.  

-Heatmap Analysis ‚Äì Visualizing areas of frequent interactions.  

-Workflow Optimization Insights ‚Äì Identifying inefficiencies to streamline operations.  

## PRODUCT MANAGEMENT APPROACH üìé
### AGILE METHODOLOGY ‚è©
To ensure a structured and iterative development process, we adopted the Agile methodology, incorporating:
Sprint Planning & Reviews ‚Äì Regularly assessing progress and refining the tool.
User Feedback Integration ‚Äì Collaborating with healthcare professionals to align the tool with real-world needs.
Cross-functional Collaboration ‚Äì Engaging with UX designers, developers, and data analysts to refine usability and performance.

## TECHNOLOGIES USED üíª
Our team employed a robust tech stack to build the solution efficiently:  

Notion - Shared work space for team members.  

Figma - Creating the prototypes to visualise the Tracker tool.  

Microsoft Teams - Communication with the ERIOS team.  

Canva - Creating the final Usability and Technical report.  

Web-based UI Frameworks (React.js & Bootstrap) ‚Äì Ensuring an intuitive user experience.  

GDPR & HIPAA Compliance Tools ‚Äì Safeguarding sensitive healthcare data.
